<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Every class has a <b>destructor</b> which is called right before an object of that class is deleted.  It is declared with the tilde notation</li>
<li>Static objects are destructed automatically at the end of the method in which they were declared.  Dynamic objects have to be destructed manually by calling <code>delete</code>, just like dynamic arrays.  Be sure to delete your dynamic objects after you're finished using them to avoid memory leaks!</li>
